# Grid-in-css
In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you can create a grid layout using the CSS Grid Layout module. 
CSS Grid allows you to create two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns, 
providing a powerful way to structure and position elements on a webpage.



In this example, we define a container with the class grid-container, 
which will be the parent element of the grid items. We use display:
grid to create the grid layout.The grid-template-columns property sets the width of the columns in the grid. 
In this case, we have three columns with equal widths, 
each taking up one fraction (1fr) of the available space.
The grid-gap property specifies the gap (or gutter) between grid items.
In this example, we set a 10-pixel gap between items.
Each grid item has the class item, 
and we apply some basic styling to them, 
such as setting a background color and padding.

With this code, the grid layout will arrange the items in three equal-width columns with a 10-pixel gap between them.
CSS Grid provides many powerful features like creating flexible layouts, 
handling row and column spans, and controlling item placement.
It's a versatile tool for building complex and responsive web layouts.
